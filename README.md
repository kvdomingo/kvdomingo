On paper, my work responsibilities correspond to that of a 💻 software engineer. However, I don't like to be confined to

- 📈 data engineer
- ☁️ cloud architect
- 🤖 AI engineer
- 📈 analytics engineer

Outside of work, I am also a(n):

- 📷 photographer
- 🎸 musician
- 🖥️ homelabber
- ⌨️🖱️ gamer
- ⚛ applied physicist
